This project is deisgned to buld a resume with very precise foprmatting from a bunch of text files containing my skills, work experience, etc.

I'm hoping I can get it to output cleanly in word and then pdf byt using pandoc, xlwings, pywin32. 

The main goal of this project is to fix the resume-formatting blocker once and for all. 

Wish me luck.
